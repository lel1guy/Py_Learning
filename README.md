# Py_Learning
Here I will document my Python learning journey form zero experience. I'll be focusing on project-based learning because I learn better by doing.   I'm also gonna be using AI to help me learn.  
I'm Using:  
python 3.14  
VS Code  
Gemini Code Assit  
NotebookLM  
Perplexity for projects ideas

Day 1:  
Project 1 - Mad Libs Word Game  
    I started by greating the user by using print comands, after i went into to collecting words from the user, for this I defined each word as a variable and used a input to get the word from the user. after wars i used story= f"""...""" and i wrote the stpry using the variables now defined to develop the story. after wards i use print to display the story. After this I used gemini code assist to learn how to save the sotry as file in the pc.  
      
Project 2 - Number guessing game  
    I Started by greating the user!  
    I used the import random to be able to get a random number for us to find, Afterwards i defined the secret_number as a randint (random interger) between 1 and 100. Then I prompt the user to guess a number in a certain number of tries.
    Then I used a while loop as long the numbers of tires was under 10. Then i used a if statment to see if the number was correct, if it was I would give the user the congrats message and break the loop, if its higher or lower it says to try higher or lower and the number of tries left. then i use a else if it wasnt found in under 10 tries. that leads to the game over screen!
